When creating this map I wanted to focus on an area that find interesting.
The geographic features of Southern Oregon and Northern California stand out to me.
This area is covered by large lakes, fault block mountains, and national lands.
I made the national lands green to stand out against the tan landcover layer.
The lakes and waterways are dark blue while wetlands are teal.
